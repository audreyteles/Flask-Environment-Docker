# Flask Enviorment with Docker 

Choose an empty folder and execute this command below to clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Audrey-Teles/Flask-Enviorment-Docker.git .
```

Run this command in the same directory to create a Docker container and start it:
``` 
docker-compose up
```

If it works, you will see your content of ```localhost:5000``` like mine in the ```https://flask101.duckdns.org/```.
